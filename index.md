## 🧾 Description

This project implements a smart door lock system that uses **face recognition** for access control.  
The system relies on an **ESP32-CAM** to detect and recognize faces and streams video live over Wi-Fi.  
When a known face is detected, it sends a signal to a **Raspberry Pi Pico 2**, written in **Rust**, which activates a **servo motor** to unlock the door and triggers visual (LED) and audio (buzzer) feedback.

All access events are **logged in real time** to a connected laptop via USB.

## 💡 Motivation

The goal of this project is to explore a practical application of embedded systems and machine vision, combining:
- Offline, low-cost **AI** via ESP32
- **Embedded Rust** programming
- Real-time feedback and logging
- A functional and extendable prototype for smart home security

## 🧠 Architecture

### System Flow

1. **ESP32-CAM**
   - Captures live video
   - Performs face detection and recognition
   - Streams to browser via local IP
   - Sends `"GRANT"` or `"DENY"` to Pico over UART

2. **Raspberry Pi Pico 2**
   - Waits for serial commands
   - Controls:
     - **Servo** for door lock
     - **LEDs** (Green = granted, Red = denied)
     - **Buzzer** for audio feedback
   - Sends event logs to laptop via USB

3. **Laptop**
   - Runs a Python script to receive and timestamp events
